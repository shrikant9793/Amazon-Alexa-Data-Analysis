# Amazon-Alexa-Data-Analysis
The current datasource in use reflects customer insights for various Amazon Echo products. The main goal of this data visualization is the get an understanding of the following:

1. How efficiently the product fulfilled the customer needs.
    A quick way to understand if your product met the customer need, is to look at the rating he/she would give.
2. Which product design grabbed the most attention from Amazon's customers in terms of purchase.(*Assuming that only 3000 customers had bought Echo in this hypothetical scenario*)
    Total sales for each Echo design will help the business understand their users even better. This could help the business to either spin up more desgins similar to the current most sought after design or take a risk and innovate new designs.
3. Customer satisfaction for each Amazon Echo design.
    By getting an estimate of different ratings that each echo design, the areas for product quality improvement can be identified.
